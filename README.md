## Predicting the Cost of Common Medical Procedures in California for Patients Covered by Medicare

This project explores my interests in consumer finance, healthcare, and public policy through the application of machine learning and data analytics concepts.
I had completed it in college, shortly after my internship in Washington D.C., where I was exposed and inspired by various public policy issues and topics.

#### Summary

This project is aimed to develop and build a model that can predict the costs of some of the most common medical inpatient procedures for
California patients who are covered by Medicare. Inpatients are patients who are admitted to the hospital for multiple days while receiving treatment. Oftentimes, their medical conditions are much
higher than others, since they require more intense around the clock care, which results in higher medical bills.

I will be using data from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services and the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services from the years 2019 to 2021.

With my interest in financial data coupled with the importance of health insurance, I see the value of machine learning in other industries. 
With this project, I aimed to learn more about health insurance and what factors influence cost, but I also saw the value in the modelâ€™s ability to allow patients 
to take control of their financial security by being able to predict how much hospital bills were going to be. The ambiguity that hospitals have around how much their 
services cost places an incredible amount of stress on patients whose sole priority should be recovery and their health. 
Even if the prediction is slightly inaccurate, having a realistic ballpark estimate is much more valuable than having none at all.
